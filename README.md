## 🗂️ State Management: Redux Toolkit, Store & Slices

This project uses **Redux Toolkit** for state management, following a modular and scalable architecture. The state is organized into slices, each responsible for a specific domain (countries, tours, favorites, etc.), and combined in a central store.

### 🏪 Store Configuration

The Redux store is configured in `src/store/store.ts` using `configureStore` from Redux Toolkit.  
All reducers from the different slices are combined here:

```ts
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import {
  countriesDataReducer,
  countryFavoritesSlice,
} from '../redux/countries-slice';
import { toursReducer, tourFavoritesSlice } from '../redux/tours-slice';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    carouselCards: countriesDataReducer,
    tours: toursReducer,
    countryFavorites: countryFavoritesSlice.reducer,
    tourFavorites: tourFavoritesSlice.reducer,
  },
});

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
export default store;
```

### 🧩 Slices Structure

Each slice manages a specific part of the state and exposes actions and selectors.

#### 1. **Countries Data Slice**
- **File:** `src/redux/countries-slice/countries-data-slice.ts`
- **Purpose:** Manages country and continent data, including images and carousel data.
- **Selectors:** For accessing countries by continent, images, etc.

#### 2. **Country Favorites Slice**
- **File:** `src/redux/countries-slice/favorite-slice-countries/country-favorites-slice.ts`
- **Purpose:** Manages favorite countries (by continent-country key).
- **Actions:** `toggleCountryFavorite`
- **Selectors:** `selectCountryFavorite`

#### 3. **Tours Data Slice**
- **File:** `src/redux/tours-slice/tours-data-slice.ts`
- **Purpose:** Manages tours by country.
- **Actions:** `initializeToursForCountry`
- **Selectors:** `selectToursForCountry`, `selectToursForContinentCountry`

#### 4. **Tour Favorites Slice**
- **File:** `src/redux/tours-slice/favorite-slice-tours/tour-favorites-slice.ts`
- **Purpose:** Manages favorite tours (by countryKey-tourId).
- **Actions:** `toggleTourFavorite`
- **Selectors:** `selectTourFavorite`, `selectTourFavoritesForCountry`

---

### 🗃️ Data Structure

#### **Images Data**
- **File:** `src/data/images-countries-data.ts`
- **Structure:** Nested object by continent, country, and image file.
- **Purpose:** Provides URLs for country/tour images.

#### **Tours Data**
- **File:** `src/data/tours-data.ts`
- **Structure:** Array of tour objects per country, with fields like `id`, `title`, `duration`, `price`, `rating`, `reviews`, `image`.
- **Purpose:** Provides the main data for tours displayed in the UI.

#### **Tour Details Data**
- **File:** `src/data/tours-details-data.ts`
- **Structure:** Object keyed by tour ID, each containing an array of day-by-day itinerary details.
- **Purpose:** Supplies detailed information for each tour, used in the trip details screens.

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

- The UI dispatches actions (e.g., to toggle favorites or initialize tours for a country).
- Slices update their part of the state accordingly.
- Selectors are used throughout the app to access and display the relevant data.
- All data is static/sample and loaded from the `src/data/` directory.
